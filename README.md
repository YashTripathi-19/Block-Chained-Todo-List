# Block-Chained-Todo-List
A decentralized application (DApp) for securely logging and verifying employee work updates using Ethereum smart contracts. Integrated with MetaMask for wallet-based authentication and Ganache for local blockchain testing.

# 🧾 Employee Daily Report System — Web3 DApp

A decentralized application (DApp) to log and verify daily work updates on the Ethereum blockchain. Built with Solidity, Web3.js, and tested locally using Ganache.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📝 Employees log their daily work
- ✅ Supervisor verifies tasks as "Completed"
- 🔐 Every action is stored immutably on the blockchain
- 🔗 Integrated with **MetaMask** for secure transaction signing
- 🧪 Developed and tested with **Ganache** (local Ethereum blockchain)
- 🎨 Frontend: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript

---

## 🔐 Blockchain Wallet: MetaMask

- MetaMask is used to connect the DApp to the user's Ethereum wallet.
- All task submissions and completions require a signed blockchain transaction.
- Works with **Sepolia Testnet** or **Ganache** local chain.

---

## 🧪 Testing Blockchain: Ganache

- Used **Ganache CLI/UI** to simulate a local Ethereum environment.
- Fast testing with multiple test accounts and live transaction logs.
- Smart contracts deployed to Ganache for initial testing before moving to testnet.
